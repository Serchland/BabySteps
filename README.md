I am trying to overwrite the popup of a ComboBox control. I know you can edit a copy of the original template and implement the changes there.
But just for fun, I was trying to retrieve the PART_Popup and overwrite it with an existing style in the application, but for some reason it doesn't work. Do you know why?
